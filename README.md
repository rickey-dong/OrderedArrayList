Discussion Summary with Breakout Room 2: Adam, Victor, Maxwell, Harry, and Faria  
= we need to import java.util.ArrayList so that we can have the T type  
= parameter is passed into NoNullArrayList  
= use super. because it's inherited  
= you can use set method and then once you check there's no nulls, just use super.  
= super.set(index i, elemment e) once you check element e isn't null
